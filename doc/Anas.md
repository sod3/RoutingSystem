# What I Worked On: Graph.cpp and Incident.cpp
# My Role: Graph and Incident System Developer

I created the file that represents the entire city as a graph. Think of it like making a digital map:

# What it stores:

Nodes = Intersections or locations (like street corners)

Edges = Roads connecting intersections

Weights = Travel time or distance for each road

Blocked Roads = Roads that are closed (accidents, construction)

# What it can do:

Load city map from a file

Find shortest path between any two locations

Handle road closures (blocked roads)

Save the map to a file

# Simple example of my map:

text
Intersection 0 --10 mins--> Intersection 1
Intersection 0 --20 mins--> Intersection 2
Intersection 1 --5 mins--> Intersection 2
